World Development Indicators Dashboard

This project presents an interactive and visual analysis of the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset, obtained from the World Bank database. The dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of global development patterns. The dataset covers information from over 260 countries and regions, containing 48 numerical and categorical features related to economic, environmental, social, and governance factors. Since the dataset contains several missing values and inconsistent year data, all indicators were cleaned, standardized, and aggregated to represent average or total values across countries rather than time-based trends.

The primary goal of this project is to visualize and compare key aspects of development, such as economic growth, population, renewable energy use, and life expectancy, along with exploring the relationships between governance, corruption, environment, and technology indicators. After cleaning, missing numerical values were replaced using mean or median imputation, duplicates were removed, and numeric columns were formatted for consistency.

The dashboard begins with four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) placed at the top section. These KPIs summarize the most critical global indicators: Average Life Expectancy, Average GDP (in current US dollars), Average Renewable Energy Consumption (%), and Total Population. Each of these values is dynamically calculated using DAX measures in Power BI and gives a quick overview of global health, economic scale, sustainability, and demographics.

Below the KPI cards, several advanced visualizations provide detailed insights. A Clustered Bar Chart highlights the Top 10 Economies by GDP, offering a comparative view of the largest contributors to the global economy. The Bubble Chart plotting GDP vs Life Expectancy further explores the relationship between wealth and quality of life, using bubble size to represent population and color to indicate renewable energy use. The CO₂ Emissions vs Energy Consumption scatter plot examines the link between industrial activity and carbon output, helping visualize sustainability challenges across countries. Another chart on Internet Usage Across Countries displays technological access levels globally, revealing disparities between developed and developing regions.

Governance and institutional quality are explored through two scatter plots: Control of Corruption vs Government Effectiveness and Voice & Accountability vs Rule of Law, showing how strong institutions often align with higher accountability and rule enforcement. Environmental and land use dynamics are depicted through a Combo Chart comparing Forest Land (%) and Agricultural Land (%), providing an understanding of land distribution between natural and economic activities. A Correlation Heatmap concludes the dashboard, summarizing relationships between major variables such as GDP, life expectancy, education, CO₂ emissions, internet usage, and poverty levels.

The dashboard layout follows a clear and structured design. The top section displays the KPIs, followed by economic and social graphs in the middle, and environmental and governance visuals below. A right-hand side panel includes slicers for selecting country, region, and population density, allowing users to explore specific subsets of the data interactively. Consistent color themes are used — blue for economic metrics, green for environmental indicators, and orange or yellow for social measures — giving the dashboard a professional and polished appearance.

This visualization highlights key insights into global development: countries with higher GDP generally enjoy longer life expectancy and wider internet access; stronger governance correlates with lower corruption; and industrial expansion tends to drive up CO₂ emissions despite progress in renewable energy adoption. The combination of economic, social, and environmental perspectives makes the dashboard a well-rounded analytical tool for understanding how nations evolve across different dimensions of development.

Overall, the World Development Indicators Dashboard serves as a compact yet insightful visualization project that transforms complex numerical data into meaningful global insights. It demonstrates the use of Power BI for storytelling through data, combining KPIs, advanced charts, and interactive filters to present a holistic view of world progress and challenges.
